permalink: /publication/2021-10-29-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'We describe a mobile app for helping people manage their mental health, keeping in mind the unique challenges offered by the Indian context. One of the biggest challenges in India is the stigma around mental health and consequently the concerns and misconceptions about reaching out for professional help. Therefore, the proposed app focuses on tackling the barriers that people experience when reaching out for help and provides a free-of-cost platform for interactions with mental health professionals to alleviate any concerns and obtain an informed view. All content is developed by clinical psychologists and rather than replacing professional help, the app provides an example of a technology intervention for mental health that supplements existing infrastructures of mental healthcare.'
